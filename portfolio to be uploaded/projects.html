            <p>Working together as a team in “Envision’23,” I developed a soil monitoring system that tracks soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. 
            This system was specifically designed for home gardeners. It honed my skills in collaborative development, sensor integration, and data analysis.</p>

            <p>As part of “The Pattarai Hackathon” held in our college, I developed a forum with my team, designed for college students and faculty. 
            The main purpose of this forum is to foster interdepartmental communication. We received a special mention in the hackathon for developing this project.</p>
